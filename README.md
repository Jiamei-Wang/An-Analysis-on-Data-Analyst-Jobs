## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 

## Project Motivation
This is an analysis on data analyst jobs based on a data set found on Kaggle. The data contains 2253 job listings for data analyst positions scraped from Glassdoor by picklesueat. My project motivation is to help people hone their job search and get their dream jobs faster!
1. Which industries/sectors/states have higher demand for data analyst?
2. How much salary can a data analyst expect to earn?
   * Min & Max Salary Distribution
   * Average Salary by "State"
   * Average Salary by "Type of Ownership"
   * Average Salary by Company "Size"
3. What are the most frequently appeared words in data analyst job descriptions?
4. Which features have more impact on the average salary of a data analyst?

## File Description
The csv file is downloaded from Kaggle, which is originally scraped from glassdoor. The jupyter notebook file contains codes of data preprocessing, data visualizations and a model prediciton of the average salary of data analyst.

## Results
* Who have higher demand for data analysts?
  * Top 3 Industries: IT, Staffing & Outsourcing and Health Care Services & Hospitals
  * Top 3 Sectors: IT, Business Services and Finance. 
  * Top 3 States: California, Texas and New York.

* How much salary can a data analyst expect ?
  * Minimum Salary Range (USD): 24K -113K (Mean: 54K)
  * Maximum Salary Range (USD): 38K -190K (Mean: 90K)
  * If you are in California, your salary could be really low or really high
  * Company size does not really have any impact on your salary amount

* What to include in your resume or interview/ What skills are required? 
  * Demonstrate your data analytics, problem-solving, communication and teamwork skills. Pay attention to their requirements of how many years of experience. A bachelor's degree will be required for most of the data analyst positions.

* What major should I choose if I want to be a data analyst?
  * There are a lot of majors that could give you a good knowledge of data analysis. However, based on this study, choosing Computer Science major would increase your  chances of getting a job because it matches more job opportunities. 

* How would the data analyst job be like?
  * You will be working on a lot of data analytics projects, most likely in a team. You may also need to work with clients, deal with products, and create reports.

Must give credit to Kaggle and Glassdoor for the data. You can find other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs). I also referrenced some codes learned from Udacity Data Science Nanodegree for the part where we define a function to find the optimal linear model and coefficient weights of the model.
